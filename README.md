# Incompleteness Ex Machina
## Abstract
In this essay we’ll prove Gödel’s incompleteness theorems twice. First, we’ll prove them the good
old-fashioned way. Then we’ll repeat the feat in the setting of computation. In the process we’ll discover
that Gödel’s work, rightly viewed, needs to be split into two parts: the transport of computation into the
arena of arithmetic on the one hand and the actual incompleteness theorems on the other. After we’re
done there will be cake.
